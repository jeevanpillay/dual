# Dual workspace configuration
# See: https://github.com/jeevanpillay/dual

# Docker image for the container runtime
image = "node:20"

# Ports your dev server uses (for reverse proxy routing)
# Example: ports = [3000, 3001]
# ports = []

# Shell command to run after container creation (e.g., dependency install)
# Example: setup = "pnpm install"
# setup = ""

# Commands to route to the container (in addition to defaults)
# Default: npm, npx, pnpm, node, python, python3, pip, pip3, curl, make
# Example: extra_commands = ["cargo", "go", "ruby"]
# extra_commands = []

# Directories to isolate with anonymous Docker volumes
# These directories get their own volume so they don't sync between host/container
# Example: anonymous_volumes = ["node_modules", ".next", "target"]
# anonymous_volumes = ["node_modules"]

# Environment variables passed to the container
# [env]
# NODE_ENV = "development"

# Files to share across all workspaces of this repo
# These are gitignored files that should be available in every branch workspace
# [shared]
# files = [".env.local", ".vercel"]
